# Q-A-Discord-Bot
A Discord Bot made to allow staff to answer a questions when a member messages the bot, this is not just a clean code to copy and paste, please edit certain spots with x's
If you need help, i strongly reccommend this video on how to code the bot, also helping with the XXXX parameters.
